# NonLinearRegressionExample-ML
Non-Linear regression is a type of polynomial regression. It is a method to model a non-linear relationship between the dependent and independent variables. It is used in place when the data shows a curvy trend, and linear regression would not produce very accurate results when compared to non-linear regression.
